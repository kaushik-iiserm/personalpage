                "My name is Kaushik Gupta and I am a 3rd year Master Student majoring in Physical Science  at iisermohali. My research interests lie at the intersection of High Energy Physics and machine learning, with a particular focus on studying jet characteristics. I became interested in this area while doing a project under Dr. Vishal Bhadrwaj, where I c: Analysing LHCâ€™s data on Particle classification with deep learning to improve real-time
                event in Elementary Physics. I worked remotely in designing Neural networks model for the seperation of Uds, Charm and Signal in Jets.

                After this project, I have had the opportunity to work with Dr Brijesh Kumar and study the light curve characteristics of Type 1A Supernova. In addition to my research, I have also been actively involved in a number of outreach and teaching initiatives, including  organizing coding workshops or events for undergraduate enthuasist.
                
                Looking to the future, I hope to continue building upon my research and make meaningful contributions to the field of High Energy Physics. Overall, I am excited to see where my passion for research takes me and am committed to making a positive impact through my work."
